# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While this repository is primarily a specification and set of templates, if you discover a security issue in any of the provided scripts, prompts, or recommended workflows (e.g., a prompt injection vulnerability in the standard prompts), please report it.

**Do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please email the maintainers directly (if email is provided) or open a **Draft Security Advisory** on GitHub if you have permissions. If neither is available, please reach out to the repository owner via private channels.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the SCP specification is actively supported.
