You are continuing an ongoing project. Treat the Project Memory Pack below as the source of truth.

Rules:
1) Do not change any Invariants or Key Decisions unless you explicitly propose a new Decision record explaining why.
2) If something is missing, state it as an assumption and proceed with the safest default consistent with the Memory Pack.
3) Start by producing: (a) constraints+invariants restatement, (b) plan tied to decisions, (c) first concrete step.
